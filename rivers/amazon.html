    <h2>Location</h2>
    <p>The Amazon River is located in South America, and stretches across Peru, Columbia, and Brazil.
    The source of the Amazon River is the Ucayali-Apur&#xED;mac river system, and it flows for over 6400 km before
    finally emptying into the Atlantic Ocean [2].</p> <!-- Source: https://www.britannica.com/place/Amazon-River -->

    <h2>Other Information</h2>

    <h3>Discovery</h3>
    <p>In 1541, Francisco de Orellana became the first European to discover the Amazon River, although it had been
    known to the indigenous locals for many years. It is believed that the name "Amazon" was a reference by Orellana
    to the mythical Amazonians of Asia. [3]</p> <!-- Source: https://www.worldatlas.com/rivers/amazon-river.html -->

    <h3>Environmental Significance</h3>
    <p>There are over 1000 known tributaries that flow into the Amazon, making it a part of one of the most involved
    river systems in the world [3]. <!-- Source: https://www.worldatlas.com/rivers/amazon-river.html -->
      Furthermore, the massive amounts of freshwater that flow through the Amazon dilute
    the Atlantic Ocean even up to 160 km from its mouth [2].</p> <!-- Source: https://www.britannica.com/place/Amazon-River -->

    <h3>Peru's Modern-Day Plans</h3>
    <p>Because the Amazon River's system extends over approximately 60% of Peru's national territory, the Peruvian
    government has extensive plans to make use of the Amazon. They intend to build 70 dams on the Amazon River, in
    addition to constructing 15 hydroelectric power plants as part of an energy deal with Brazil [4].</p> <!-- Source: https://archive.internationalrivers.org/campaigns/peruvian-amazon -->
